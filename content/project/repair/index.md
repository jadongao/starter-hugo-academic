On April 5 of 2022, a day during the pandemic, one of our neighbor posted a plea for 
help in our community group. She said her computer charger had broken, and her child 
needed it for online classes. They were unable to buy a new one due to halted deliveries. 
Several neighbors kindly offered their chargers, but unfortunately, none of them were 
compatible. 

Seeing the neighbor's urgency, I wondered how I could assist them. After careful 
consideration, I realized the wire was broken and could be soldered back together. My dad 
had the necessary equipment, but he was not home, and I had never repaired something like 
this before, so I wasn't sure if I could fix it properly. However, it seemed like repairing it was 
the only solution available. I decided to give it a try.

I asked the neighbor to bring me the broken charger, and after disinfecting it, I plugged 
in the soldering iron and began the process of soldering the wire. Fortunately, it only required 
soldering a few old copper wires, which wasn't too difficult. Within a few minutes, I had 
completed the repair and secured it with heat shrink tubing. When I returned the charger to 
the neighbor, I advised her to handle it gently as it was soldered and couldn't withstand 
excessive pulling force. 

A week later, the neighbor approached me again, saying that the wire had broken once 
more, this time at the root, making it impossible to solder again without opening the adapter's 
casing. I tried using pliers to open the casing but couldn't succeed. I searched online for 
tutorials and found one. The video said, "First step, open it," and magically, the casing opened. 
But no matter how much I tried, it just wouldn't open. The video showed a specialized tool 
that we didn't have. We tried prying it open with pliers, but it was futile. I realized once again 
that knowing how to do something and actually being able to do it were two different things. 
I was ready to give up, thinking I had done my best. However, the next day, I reconsidered. If 
I couldn't fix it, the child wouldn't be able to attend online classes. So, I decided to give it 
another try.

After about half an hour of attempts, there was a loud "pop," and the casing finally 
opened. I quickly soldered the connecting wires, put the casing back together, and it was 
perfectly repaired, looking brand new. The neighbor was pleasantly surprised. That evening, 
she made a small cake for me as a token of gratitude. It warmed my heart, and the cake tasted 
amazing.
