I'm a high school student in Shanghai, China. Academically, I love learning physics and especially like to ponder about hard problems. I also like to read random books and articles that I find on a bookshelf or the internet. These may contain topics such as AI (I'm rather scared of it), philosophy, and literature (currently reading works by Raymond Carver, who doesn't like simple stories?).
