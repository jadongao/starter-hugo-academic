              We'll go through all topics in AP Physics C Mechanics, from basic kinematics all the way to rotations and gravitation. Feel free to join even if you have no calculus background since we'll go through all math prerequisites as a part of this course (it won't turn into a calculus series). Without calculus, this course's content is very similar to AP Physics 1. Problem solving sessions where we go over specific problems after each topic will also be hosted between "lecturey" sessions.

              The plan for now is to meet weekly and share problems we're working on. We can solve each other's confusions. Currently, there is a set of resources I found online which includes a complete set of problems that we may do over the week and discuss upon so we stay on the same track.

          Initiated ‚ÄúWeekly Challenge Problems‚Äù Project. These puzzles are designed to be interesting problems that are unclear at first sight. But they will be neat and fun to think about.

      # In Autumn 2022, I was the TA for Stanford's introductory quantum field theory class, taught by [Prof. Bernhard Mistlberger](https://sites.google.com/view/bernhardmistlberger/start). We overhauled the course and produced new problem sets, which we believe strike a good balance between traditional particle physics applications, and connections to other fields. I also taught weekly sections which laid out the big picture and showed tricks for doing the problems efficiently.
