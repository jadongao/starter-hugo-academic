Imagine you have a friend who’s extremely talented at music, and he challenges you to the following: you are given a musical chord, which is basically a few notes played at the same time, like this: (chord). And all you need to do is find out what the individual notes are, in this case it’s the following: (music).

There’s just one issue, you know nothing about music. But, luckily for you, there’s one tool that can save you from losing this challenge: the Fourier Transform (letters). 



Essentially, sound is passed through vibrating air molecules. The first set of air molecules pass on their vibration to the next, compressing and expanding the space in between in a rhythmic pattern as it reaches you ear.

For instance, if we take one note and graph this change in compression over time, you can see a really nice oscillating pattern. 

Ok, now, the frequency is what we need to focus the most on because that differentiates our notes. It is a measure of how fast waves are oscillating, and determines the unique pitch for sound waves. 

If we increase the frequency, making air molecules around us vibrate faster, the pitch gets higher. 

For one note there’s just one frequency, and we can identify it easily on the graph. But our friend challenged us to many notes combined, and if we take the sum of say five notes, the resulting air pressure graph will look much more complicated.


That’s where the Fourier transform comes in. The basic idea is that pretty much all functions can be dissected into simple sinusoidal waves, whether it’s our pressure curve (pressure curve) or a seemingly random curve like me speaking (speaking curve). And by applying this strangely looking mathematical formula, we can get back a frequency distribution of the simple sine curves that composed the original curve. 

This is the frequency distribution for your friend’s chord. Identifying the spikes allow us to see the major contributing frequencies. Remember, the frequencies refer to the notes, so now we know all our notes. 

The Fourier transform is perhaps one of the most common tools embedded in modern technologies. Dissecting functions into its frequency components also allows us to store images and videos, process signals sent to your cellphones, and even scan your heart’s rhythm. But after all this mess, you can now confidently say that you’re able to identify your friend’s chords.
