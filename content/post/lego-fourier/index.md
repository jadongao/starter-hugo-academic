# 1. Why did I make it? Because it’s so coool!
I was instantly attracted by the harmonic analyzer made by Albert Michelson the moment I saw it and decided to recreate it right then. With the aid of other LEGO lovers online and some other makers who’ve also tried the same thing, I built this 7-frequency Fourier Analyzer (I prefer this name over the “harmonic analyzer”). Aside from being cool, it was an excellent tool for demonstrating what Fourier Analysis is to others. 


# 2. Overview of the Analyzer
Simply put, the analyzer has to achieve two things: decompose and synthesize. Since the two have parallel math equations, I only need to consider synthesis. The motor and the gear set separate one frequency into seven. Each of these is then connected to an amplitude bar. Each bar is then connected with one spring. The linear spring forces add together at the summing bar, representing the total displacement shown on the resulting graph.

## Example of Fourier analysis

Taking Fourier synthesis (5 sinusoids element) as an example,

<!--![sinusoid function graph of computer](./computer%20function%20graph.jpg) -->
<div align=center> <img src='./computer%20function%20graph.jpg'> </div>

where $a_n$ is -1, +1, -1, +1, -1

F (x)= -sin(x)+sin(2x)-sin(3x)+sin(4x)-sin(5x)

Using this LEGO Fourier Analyzer, the actual output function graph is as follows, which is very close to the graph drawn by the computer.

## Parts of analyzer
This LEGO machine consists of the following parts:

<div align=center> <img src='./overview%20with%20label.jpg' width = 80%/> </div>

### 3.1 Frequency generator
The frequency generator is a gearbox with seven output shafts of different frequencies. The rotational speeds on the seven axes are 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, and 7x, respectively.

### 3.2 Sinusoid generator
The sinusoid generator has seven gears to move Rocker arms, converting the circular rotation generated by the frequency generator into sinusoidal motion. This combination of mechanical elements produces the seven different sinusoidal waves: sin(1x), sin(2x), sin(3x), sin(4x), sin(5x), sin(6x), and sin(7x).

### 3.3 Ample bars, weight the sinusoids
There are 7 sinusoidal motions weighted: $a_1$*sin(1x), $a_2$*sin(2x), $a_3$*sin(3x), $a_4$*sin(4x), $a_5$*sin(5x), $a_6$*sin(6x), and $a_7$*sin(7x).
### 3.4 Summing lever
Summing lever at the top of the machine adds together the weighted sinusoids.

### 3.5 Platen and Plumb
The platen moves horizontally, and the plumb moves vertically. The pen tied to the plumb draws a function graph of the calculation result on the recording paper.

# 4. How do I make it?
Since March 2022, I have been in contact with the Harmonic Analyzer, designed by physicist Albert Michelson for studying calculus and Fourier transform, and its clever design has deeply impressed me. So I wanted to make one myself at home. The entire process took considerable time and effort to complete each component.

The sinusoid generator and frequency generator are two essential parts:

### Frequency generator
The frequency generator is a gearbox, and I am amazed by the clever design of Youtuber @thoroughfareproduction. However, because this YouTuber only provided videos without detailed installation drawings, I couldn't see his internal structure and had to explore it myself. I first completed a 5-axis gearbox like a YouTuber's machine, and after finishing it, my confidence doubled. I challenged and assembled a 7-axis gearbox.

<div align=center> <img src='./frequency%20generator%20gear%20set.jpg' width = 70%/> </div>

This machine uses almost all LEGO gears: 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 36 teeth gear. Since I don't have all gear types at home, I temporarily used a 3D printer to print several types. Later, I replaced the 3D-printed parts with purchased LEGO parts, which made the operation more stable. This method of testing before formal procurement dramatically improves production efficiency, eliminating the need to wait several days to receive LEGO parts before testing.

### Sinusoid generator
The sinusoid generator uses LEGO worm gear to transmit circumferential rotation, but during the manufacturing process, there was a problem. Due to the fixed position of the gears and worm, the worm would get stuck during operation, and the entire device could not operate then. I had to take a break until a few months later when I had time to conduct many repeated experiments and finally found a solution. The final method found is straightforward: to make the worm position lose to avoid jamming. But to see this method, I should do many repeated disassembly and assembly. 

The device that drives the LEGO beam to form sinusoidal motion is crucial. Youtuber @thoroughfareproduction used a simple bolt connection, but the bolt connection was loose due to the need for rotation, which caused the gears and beam to shake often. I made improvements using a 3D-printed model and bearings, and it is no longer a classic LEGO work.

# 5.Why do I make it?

When learning sound waves, I came across the idea that chords are composed of different combinations of sounds, and using Fourier Analysis, chords can be decomposed into the frequencies of their constituent sounds. I am very interested in Fourier Analysis, and I saw videos online from Professor Bill Hammack and YouTuber @thoroughfareproduction, both dedicated to visualizing complex mathematical concepts in Fourier Analysis. So, I decided to learn from them and make a LEGO machine myself. When making this machine, I also traced the history of Fourier Analysis. I had a chance to communicate with these masters during this production process, and I felt their imaginative ideas in the era without electronic computers.

# 6.What's the most meaningful thing you've made?

This LEGO machine can correspond one-to-one with mathematical formulas, which visualizes mathematical concepts and helps me understand them.

The production process of this machine was a perfect visual learning. It's very consistent with my experience as a tutor in a schoolhouse. The visual teaching method enables students to see and touch the abstract concepts they have learned, bringing students (including myself) closer to the abstract concepts.
