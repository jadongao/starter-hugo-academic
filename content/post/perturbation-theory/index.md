Abstract: Perturbation has been widely used as a tool to approximate complex quantum systems that are slight deviations from well-known systems. Among many widely studied potentials, one perturbation is the effect of applying an electric field onto an atom known as the Stark effect. This paper contributes a qualitative summary of the graphical solution of the linear Stark effect in Hydrogen atoms of n=2.
