## Abstract:
Masks have become the most basic health protection barrier for people during the epidemic, but wearing masks for a long time often leads to difficulty breathing and a feeling of suffocation. The device designed in this project uses a fan to reduce the difference in air pressure between the inside and outside of the mask to improve the smoothness of inhalation, significantly improving the suction resistance of the mask while not affecting its original exhalation resistance. The device is small in size and can be carried around, powered by a power bank. All materials can be obtained from the market, and the cost is low, making it more suitable for ordinary people to use.
