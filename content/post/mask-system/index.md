# 1.What kinds of things is this work?

Masks have become the most basic health protection barrier for people during the epidemic, but wearing masks for a long time often leads to difficulty breathing and a feeling of suffocation. The device designed in this project uses a fan to reduce the difference in air pressure between the inside and outside of the mask to improve the smoothness of inhalation, significantly improving the suction resistance of the mask while not affecting its original exhalation resistance. The device is small in size and can be carried around, powered by a power bank. All materials can be obtained from the market, and the cost is low, making it more suitable for ordinary people to use.

# 4.How do I make it?




To solve the long-term comfort of mask matching, it is necessary to develop and analyze the structure of the mask. Masks are usually composed of multiple layers of filtering materials, and air can only enter after being filtered layer by layer, which is hindered by the filtering layer. The better the filtering performance of a mask, the greater the resistance to breathing.

Masks purchased from pharmacies usually indicate respiratory resistance, which is measured using professional instruments. In order to accurately determine the resistance of the mask in this project, the AS510 handheld micro pressure gauge was used to measure the pressure difference inside and outside the mask (specific measurement methods can be found in the appendix). For example, the KN95 mask has a pressure difference of+40Pa between the inside and outside of the mask when exhaling, and -40Pa between the inside and outside of the mask when inhaling. The professional KN99 mask was not tested in this project, and according to online data, the breathing pressure difference can reach 100-200Pa.

From the pressure difference data, it can be seen that the better the protective performance of the mask, the more difficult it will be to breathe. The direct way to relieve suffocation after wearing a mask is to reduce respiratory resistance and the pressure difference inside and outside the mask.




# 5.Why do I make it?

In 2021, the world is facing unprecedented COVID, and masks have become the most basic health protection barrier for people. Due to protective requirements, people need to ensure that the mask is tightly pressed against their face when wearing it, and the mask cannot be easily removed. When wearing a mask for a long time, they often feel difficulty breathing and suffocation. Especially for some medical staff, they need to provide long-term support for several hours, or even more than ten hours, within a day. Difficulty breathing can even lead to life-threatening situations. There have been reports of students running with high protective masks causing shock.

# Additional Information

## Measurement of Pressure Difference of Mask

<div align=center> <img src='./AS510.jpg' width = 80%/> </div>

The AS510 handheld micro pressure gauge (priced around 150 yuan on Taobao) has a measurement range of 0-100hPa and a measurement accuracy of Â± 0.03hPa.

Measurement method:

1) Turn on the power of AS510 and reset it to zero

2) Insert a trachea of AS510 into the mask, close to the mouth and nose;

3) Place the other trachea outside the mask

4) The display screen of AS510 shows the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the mask
