Research on Photo-Varistor Based on Lateral Bipolar Photoresistance Effect
Gao Mingjun
Abstract: At present, there has been research on the lateral bipolar photoresistance effect of 
various semiconductor materials, which suggests that some semiconductor materials have the 
potential to be used to prepare a new type of photo-varistor based on the lateral bipolar 
photoresistance effect. However, further research and optimization of the production process of 
this type of photo-varistor have not been conducted. This project conducted in-depth research on 
the production process of this type of photo-varistor. Firstly, I conducted a series of experiments 
and selected two semiconductor materials with good linearity: one was Ag/SiO2/Si P-type 
silicon corroded for 10 minutes, and the other was Ag/SiO2/Si N-type silicon corroded for 5 
minutes. Subsequently, I combine these silicon chips with 3D printing components to create two 
photo-varistors. Furthermore, I will use the Arduino circuit to monitorthe voltage of photovaristorssensor. This project contributes to the application and commercialization of the photovaristor based on lateral bipolar photoresistance effect.
